# Stock_market_prediction_ML

In this project, we tried to develop a prediction model for the stock market based on the 
technical analysis using LSTM stock market data. 

• LSTM model are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they are able to store 
past information. 

• This could guide the future investors in the stock market to make profitable investment 
decisions whether to buy or sell or hold a share. 

• Stock markets are hard to monitor and require plenty of context when try to interpret the 
movement and predict prices. 

• They are able to keep track of context specific temporal dependencies between stock prices 
for a longer period of time while performing predictions.
